# Flintstones Art Gallery â€” repo

Yabba-dabba-doo! ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to the Flintstones Art Gallery codebase.  
Iâ€™m Fred â€” owner, chief pebble-polisher, and the fellow who insists that every artwork looks better with a little club polish. This repo contains the front-end, asset pipeline, build scripts, and everything needed to show off our Stone Age-inspired collection.

## Backstory
Fred started this gallery to celebrate ancient-modern art: rock murals, chisel portraits, and animated fossils.
The pebble trail is how you find the good stuff.

## Whatâ€™s in this repository
- Production-ready, responsive gallery UI with image lightbox, filtering, and metadata display.
- Image optimization pipeline (resize, WebP conversion, lazy loading) for fast load times.
- SEO + accessibility-forward markup (Open Graph, sitemap).
- CI/CD workflows for continuous builds and near-zero downtime deployments.
- Contribution guidelines and a content-staging workflow (artists may need to sign license placeholders).

## Key deliverables
- Paginated gallery grid with search and tags
- High-performance lazy-loading + progressive image delivery
- Metadata-driven pages: title, artist, year, provenance
- Static export + SSR-compatible structure (works on GitHub Pages / Vercel / Netlify)
- Automated tests for build integrity and link validation

## Contact
If you find a bug in the demo site or a broken image, send a cheerful note to `curator@flintstone.art` â€” but remember, the true trail is in history - that's what the gallery is all about. Yabba-dabba-doo!
